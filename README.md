# Microcosm
Just a little 4X game written in Python using the library [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel).
Inspiration taken from games I've played.

## Pre-requisites
Playing Microcosm requires an installation of VLC media player on the player's machine. Installation instructions for
your favourite operating system can be found [here](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). If your operating system lists
python-vlc (or something like that) as an optional dependency, it is advised that players also install that. Naturally,
Python is also required, at version 3.10 or above.

### Global multiplayer
In order to play games of Microcosm online, your computer and router must have UPnP enabled, as it is required for
communication between clients and the server.

## Play from release

Begin by downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/ChrisNeedham24/microcosm/releases/latest) for your operating system.

### macOS

1. Extract the downloaded zip; double-clicking it in Finder is the easiest way.
2. An application will be extracted - right click it and select Open.
3. In the displayed security-related dialog, press the Open button again to start the game.

Please note that only ARM64 architectures are supported.

### Linux

In terms of Linux distros, Fedora is explicitly supported and Ubuntu is built for, but the build is not tested. Other distros should find success in one of these two.

Additionally, only x86 architectures are supported.

1. Extract the downloaded tarball using `tar -xzvf`.
2. A binary will be extracted; run `./microcosm` to start the game.

### Windows

1. Extract the downloaded zip.
2. An EXE file will be extracted - run this to start the game, allowing Windows Defender to run any scans if it asks to do so.

## Play from package

1. Run `pip install --user microcosm-4x`
2. Run `microcosm`
    1. Note: if this doesn't work, make sure Python's user scripts directory is on your PATH.
       See [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#installing-to-the-user-site) for instructions.

## Play from source

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

"""
The following migrations have occurred during Microcosm's development:

v1.1
- AI players had their playstyle expanded to not only include attacking, but also expansion.
  This is migrated by mapping directly to the attacking attribute, and setting the expansion attribute to neutral.
- Relics were added, adding the is_relic attribute to Quads. This is migrated by setting all quads without the attribute
  to False.
- Imminent victories were added for players, telling players when they or others are close to winning the game. This can
  be migrated by simpling setting them to an empty set if the attribute is not present, as it will be populated next
  turn.
- The eliminated attribute was added for players, which can be determined by checking the number of settlements the
  player has.

v1.2
- Climatic effects were added to the game as a part of its configuration. This can be mapped to False, and night
  counters can be mapped to zero.

v2.0
- Factions were added for players. As it would be difficult for players to choose, their faction can be determined from
  the colour they chose.
- The player faction was also added to the game configuration, replacing player colour, which can be determined in the
  same way as above.

v2.2
- Healing units were added. All existing unit plans can be mapped to False for the heals attribute.
- The has_attacked attribute was changed to has_acted for units, and this can be directly mapped across.
- The sieging attribute for units was changed to besieging, and this can also be mapped directly.
- The under_siege_by attribute keeping track of the optional unit besieging the settlement was changed to a simple
  boolean attribute called besieged. Migration can occur by mapping to True if the value is not None.

v2.3
- The location of quads became recorded. All existing quads can be mapped to their index if they are for the board, or
  mapped to their settlement's location if they are for a settlement.

v2.4
- Deploying units and their plans were added. Since they had their own unique properties, no migration for existing
  units is required, and the new deploying units can be identified by these properties.

v3.0
- Resources were added, adding the resource attribute to Quads, and the resources attribute to Settlements and Players.
  These are migrated by setting Quads without the attribute to have None and Settlements and Players without the
  attribute to have empty ResourceCollections. In addition to these, the req_resources attribute was added to
  Improvements, which is migrated and removed for old saves, as they would have no way of obtaining the necessary
  resources.

v4.0
- Quad yields were adjusted to be integer values rather than float ones. Float values from previous versions are rounded
  to the closest integer.
- Multiplayer games were introduced; GameConfig objects from previous versions are naturally mapped to Disabled.

v4.1
- Local multiplayer games were introduced; GameConfig objects from previous versions have their multiplayer boolean
  field mapped from False to Disabled, and from True to Global, as Local games did not exist previously.
